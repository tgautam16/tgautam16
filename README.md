### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I am Tasha.

ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate on interesting data science projects to solve complex real-world problems.

ðŸ”­ I am working on developing algorithms to search for and analyse data for new pulsars (Neutron Stars).

ðŸ”­ These days I am also exploring interesting/novel ways to utilize Machine Learning Algorithms for pulsar candidate sorting.
